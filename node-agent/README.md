# Node Agent

The node agent runs on each machine setup my MockFog2.
Normally it is being rolled out by the MockFog Node Manager, but it can also be installed manually.

## Installation and Configuration

- Run `npm install`
- Install [tcconfig](https://tcconfig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/installation.html)
- Configure which port to use by setting the environmental variable **Port**, default is 3000
- Start the agent with `node app.js`
- Open *localhost:3000* (or whatever you have configured) in your browser, you will be able to control the Node Agent through an interface generated by swagger.
