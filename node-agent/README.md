# Node Agent

The node agent runs on each machine setup my MockFog2.
Normally it is being rolled out by the MockFog Node Manager, but it can also be installed manually.
When it has been rolled out via MockFog, its swagger interface can be accessed at *<url>:<port>* (for port see your `infrastructure.jsonc`).

## Installation and Configuration

- Run `npm install`
- Install [tcconfig](https://tcconfig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/installation.html)
- Configure which port to use by setting the environmental variable **AGENT_PORT**, default is 3000
- Start the agent with `node app.js`
- Open *<url>:<port>* in your browser, you will be able to control the Node Agent through an interface generated by swagger.
